&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bees sting and pop the ball&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They evolve and turn into wasps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wasps have a quicker attack and have a longer flight range also have a more lethal sting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bees have a limited flight range&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Knock bees out with fly swatters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bees have one stinger but wasps have three&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stings absorbed by bee amunity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each wasp sting absorbed by three amunity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bees and wasps wear top hats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wasps are bigger than bees&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Flowers&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sunflowers are the main flower that you will see throughout the game.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some sunflowers will be wilted and collapse 1 second after contact with the ball.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bellflowers catapult you forward into the air and you will fly for 5 seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swaying sunflowers sway in the wind and you have to calculate when to jump on them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dandelions let off dandelion seeds that carry you through the air.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Player is a beach ball bouncing on sunflowers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your currency in the game are flower petals and stars (stars are
more valuable than flower petals)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flower color are the colors in your color inventory (you slowly
collect them while you play)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some sunflowers sway from side to side&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evil bees and worms eat or pop ball&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Butterflies and dandelion seeds carry you around&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The floor is covered with goatheads or/and cacti&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are gopher holes that you can use to escape the obstacles but
you have to watch out for the gopher that will chase you down the
tunnels in the gopher holes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the shop you can buy a bee protective shield or 3 bee shields
make one wasp shield&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are wasps and they can sting faster and have a longer
distance range&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can customize your beach ball in the shop using flower colors
for custom design or you can buy pre-made designs using flower
petals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bell flowers can catapult you forward&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some sunflowers go up and down&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thorny goatheads pop you&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The sunflowers will have faces that show if they are healthy/alive,
eaten, or wilted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many different types of sunflower. Here are a few:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Regular sunflowers have happy faces and stand still and don&amp;rsquo;t do anything
exept wilt over a set period time. Face:O O U&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wilted sunflowers will break if you sit on them for too long. When they wilt,
they will be bent over and have a brownish tint and look sick. They will have
sad faces. Face: O O n&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Swaying sunflowers have silly faces and will sway from side to side. Player
will have to time their jump or will fall off the sunflower and have to either
get back on or face the consequences below. Face: @ @ Y&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eaten sunflowers have x eyes and little bites on the sides. They break as soon
as you jump on them, then you fall onto the ground. are often near gopher
holes or near different animals. They eat the sunflowers. These don&amp;rsquo;t come
very often. Face: X X n There are more types of flowers like&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bell flower cannons are basically bell flowers. If you jump on one, it will
slingshot you. You can&amp;rsquo;t controll how far it slingshots you, and you can&amp;rsquo;t
controll where you go either. They slingshot you in the opposite direction the
flower is from the stem (if it&amp;rsquo;s on the left, it will slingshot you forwards,
if it&amp;rsquo;s on the right, it will slingshot you backwards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weeds will hide stuff on the ground, and there&amp;rsquo;s usually a small gap where
they are; they take over from the sunflowers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dandelions will scatter seeds that you can ride on. You can not controll where
you go, and dissapear, leaving the seed. You can grab the seed to plant
another dandelion (ex. if you need to cross a patch of weeds)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: Underground</title><link>https://temperate-designs.github.io/sunflower-dash/docs/game-design/underground/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://temperate-designs.github.io/sunflower-dash/docs/game-design/underground/</guid><description>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bottles are a quick way to get underground.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sleeping gophers chase you when you walk into the tunnel. If you have a snail
shell you can disguise and walk right past the sleeping gophers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gophers chase you until you get out of the tunnel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worms make small tunnels that you can escape from the gophers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Worms will pop you if you get too close to them.&lt;/li>
